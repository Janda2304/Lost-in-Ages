-Why am i adding so much mods in one update?
-I just feel that Lost in Ages is incomplete and loses out a lot of potential on the lack of mods in it, if you don't like this update i'm sorry but this was a step that i felt must be done
-also a lot of added mods are just some QoL features or something little (like More Storage Drawers, Not Enough Energistics, PackagedAuto, Rubidium)
